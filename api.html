            	  <p>We decided to dig into two commonly used API's: reCAPTCHA and Cloud Vision. These two will be covered below.</p>

                	<h3 class="heading">reCAPTCHA</h3>
                    <p>Each and everyone of us internet users have come across our fair share of CAPTCHAs to verify whether or not we are human. However, does not being able to read the blurry, vague and confusing signs mean we are not made up of flesh and blood? Certainly, it does not. Being able to make mistakes is ironically enough what makes us human. As opposed to that, AI are getting so good at CAPTCHAs that they have a 99.8% passing rate, which defeats the purpose of the CAPTCHA. Google found an efficient and user friendly way of dealing with this: “no CAPTCHA reCAPTCHA”. This is usually displayed as a single box to tick, with words written next to it stating “I am not a robot”. An audio version has been brought out as well, to accommodate for the visually impaired. Simple enough right? There’s actually more to it than it may seem.</p>

					<p>It works by analysing how the user has dealt with the CAPTCHA feature in the past. If the status of the user cannot be determined for whatever reason, a series of cues and prompts follow to add additional security checkpoints to ensure whether or not the user is actually human. Such as a new CAPTCHA (not reCAPTCHA) to confirm that the user is valid. However, instead of using hard to read words, it shows photos of situations with letters, numbers etc in them. reCAPTCHA follows the HTTPS protocol.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="heading">Render the reCAPTHCHA on your website (<i>automatically</i>)</h3>
                    <p>To render the reCAPTCHA widget on your website, using the following source code is the easiest way to do it. There are no restrictions as to include this code in your source code.</p>
                    
                    <blockquote class="code">
                    	<code>                        
                        &lt;html&gt;<br />
 							&lt;head&gt;<br />
   								&lt;title&gt;reCAPTCHA demo: Simple page&lt;/title&gt;<br />
   	 							&lt;script src="https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api.js" async defer&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<br />
 							&lt;/head&gt;<br />
 							&lt;body&gt;<br />
  		 						&lt;form action="?" method="POST"&gt;<br />
    			 					&lt;div class="g-recaptcha" data-sitekey="your_site_key"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;<br />
     								&lt;br/&gt;<br />
     								&lt;input type="submit" value="Submit"&gt;<br />
   								&lt;/form&gt;<br />
 							&lt;/body&gt;<br />
						&lt;/html&gt;<br />                        
                        </code>
                    </blockquote>
                    
                    <p>You could render a reCAPTCHA widget explicitly as well, but that offers more room for mistakes than the method shown above. If you want to do it explicitly, you will need to specify an onload callback function followed by inserting the Javascript resource. Then you should set the onload parameter to the name of your onload callback function, and the render parameter needs to be explicit.
</p>
                    <p>If you want to know even more about how to render reCAPTCHA widgets, you can check out the <a href="https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/display#config">following</a> website.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="heading">Request and Response</h3>
                    <p>When a reCAPTCHA has been solved by a user, a new field (g-captcha-response) will be populated in HTML. There are then three methods of verifying the user’s response: <ul>
                    	<li>g-captcha-response POST parameter when the user submits the form on your site..</li>
                        <li>After the user has completed the CAPTCHA test with grecaptcha.getResponse(opt_widget_id).</li>
                        <li>To your callback function, as a sting argument, if data-callback is specified the callback parameter in the grecaptcha.render method or the g-recaptcha tag attribute.</li>
                     </ul></p>
                     
                    <p>You should only verify the reCAPTCHA response once, if server side validation using an AJAX request is performed by your website. Response tokens cannot be re-used after a verify attempt has been made with them already. To do so, you need to call grecaptcha.reset() to ask the user to re-verify with reCAPTCHA.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="heading">API Request and Response</h3>
                    <p>The URL for the requests is <a href="https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api/siteverify">https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api/siteverify</a> using the POST method. There are three types of POST Parameters: secret, response and remoteip. Secret requires the shared key between your site and ReCAPTCHA as a description. Response requires the user response token provided by the reCAPTCHA to the user and provided to your site on as a description. Remoteip however does not require a description, though it is optional. If you were to add a description to remoteip, it would have to be the user’s IP-address.</p>
                    
                    <p>The response is a JSON object that looks something like this:</p>
                    <blockquote class="code">
                    	<code>
                    	{ <br />
 							"success": true|false,<br />
 							"challenge_ts": timestamp, <br />
 							"hostname": string,    <br />      
							"error-codes": [...]<br />
						}<br />
						</code>
                    </blockquote>
                    
                    <p>“success” seems pretty self-explanatory, “challenge_ts” is  the timestamp of the challenge load (ISO format yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ssZZ), “hostname” is the hostname of the site on which the reCAPTCHA was solved and “error-codes” are optional, but this title is quite self-explanatory as well. Down below we will show you the possible error codes.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="heading">Error-codes</h3>
                    <p>“missing-input-secret” means that the secret parameter is missing.<br />
“missing-input-response” means that the response parameter is missing.<br />
“invalid-input-secret” means that the input for the secret parameter is invalid.<br />
“invalid-input-response”means that the input for the response parameter is invalid.</p>
					
                    <h3 class="heading">Making it mobile friendly</h3>
                    <p>A way to easily create a reCAPTCHA for mobile users is by exploiting weakness of Computer Vision: Use images and ask the user to label them. This is more mobile friendly than the former CAPTCHAs, for it is easier to tap photos that match a description than to type barely understandable words on the small, touchscreen keyboard.</p>
                    <p>This ‘reCAPTCHA’ has made surfing the interwebs simpler and more efficient for its users, whist still being secure. Although this only a small step into improving security that keeps us safe from abusive agents on the web, Google has again made a great contribution to internet security with their no CAPTCHA reCAPTCHA API.</p>

                	<h3 class="heading">Cloud Vision</h3>
                    <p>Cloud Vision is an API for in-house image recognition tech: the technology is capable of recognising objects in images and classifying them. This will be very useful in apps for which real-world interactions are critical. For example, it can be used to identify unwanted or inappropriate content to block this automatically, such as owned content. Before the Cloud Vision API, it was almost impossible to protect branded photos. It could also be used to identify characters within images and turning them into text.</p>
                    <p>Before Cloud Vision there was Google’s Prediction API, to which Cloud Vision is very similar. However, Cloud Vision opens up possibilities regarding the limited capability of Prediction. The new API offers anything from optical character recognition to identifying a user’s face as a security measure.  It can analyse emotion qualities of people in photos and find emotions such as happiness, sadness and anger. It is also capable of detecting product logos.</p>
                    <p>The fact that the Cloud Vision API only works on static content (so photos, but not videos), makes it seem very similar to Microsoft’s Project Oxford as Oxford is also capable of detecting emotional traits in photos. The Microsoft project returns the emotional state detected from the eight possibilities as text labels above the images.</p>
                    <p>What makes Google’s API different is that instead of the plain emotional state, it returns the likelihood of certain emotions. This makes it more reliable than Project Oxford, because it is not black and white; it includes the grey areas.</p>
