                	  <h1>Less major Android Products</h1>
                	  <p>Aside from mobile phones and tablets, there are some less popular Android devices. This includes the watch, TV, Car and Chromecast. Eventhough they could not go unmentioned, we did decide to keep this short.</p>
                      <h3>Smartwatch</h3>
                      <p>The watches are very similar to the Apple smartwatch. Notifications are synced with the watch, apps can be built so that they can be controlled by the watch (whilst being stored on your phone). Often GPS will be included in an Android smartwatch, as well as being able to play offline music.</p>
                      <p>Great, but how do they work? Back in 2002, Microsoft came out with a new technology called Smart Personal Object Technology (SPOT). This tech was designed to make everyday objects, like watches, more useful by integrating ‘smart’ software. This did not last very long, as watches built around SPOT were discontinued in 2008. However, the creation of smartwatches did not end there. This is where the story of Android Wear begins.</p>
                      <p>Android Wear is works with a streamlined operating system designed specifically for wearbles. The watch therefore is a smaller version with the main purpose of enhancing the user’s experience. The thing that makes Android Wear enhance the user’s experience is mainly Google Now.</p>
                      <h3>Google Now</h3>
                      <p>Google Now is a service formerly introduced on the Google Search app back in the days when Android phones ran on Jelly Bean. Since then, it has been spread to Google Glass, desktops and portable devices. People might think that it is Google’s interpretation of Siri, but they could not be more wrong.</p>
                      <p>Google Now works by looking back at your search patterns and monitoring them. This includes web history, apps and other programs. Based on your history, it then tries to supply information or alerts that may be useful to you. This ranges from weather at your location/destination and standard notifications to currency conversions and travel tips. You can also give it permission to pull information from your Google accounts to check out your Gmail, for example. Google Now keeps track of time, your current location and locations history to ensure that you are being kept up to date.</p>
                      
                      <h3>Android TV</h3>
                      <p>Android TV is a special version of Android designed for TVs, as suggested by its name. This software is based on easy and fast ways to watch media. Android TV can be remote controlled, as well as voice controlled. When you search for anything, such as “Orange Is The New Black”, information regarding your search (in this case series and actors) will be shown, as well as the option to watch the series via Netflix or Google Play Films. This also works for more vague searches such as “films that have won an Oscar in 2015”, in the same way as Google Now. You can also ask Android TV questions such as “What’s Ajax’s real name?” to which the TV app will reply “Francis”. Alright, the last one was not true, but would that not be great? It does however work if you were to ask “Who played Ajax/Francis in Deadpool?”, to which the TV app would then reply “Ed Skrein”.</p>
                      <p>Android TV also allows you to install games and other apps onto your TV, downloaded from the Google Play Store.</p>
                      
                      <h3>Google Chromecast</h3>
                      <p>Chromecast is a small device that can be plugged into an HDMI port of your HDTV, which is powered by a USB cable. Using either your smartphone or computer as a remote control, Chromecast can be used to access video content from Youtube, Netflix, Google Play Store etc. You can also use this to play games such as Just Dance on your TV, with your smartphone as a remote. It can pretty much be used to stream any type of content from your Chrome browser as well. </p>
                      <p>So all you need to access Chromecast is the Chromecast stick, an HDTV with empty HDMI port, Wi-Fi connection and either a computer or mobile device. The USB cable and power adapter for the Chromecast stick come included with the stick. What should be noted is that Chromecast does not only work with Android, but also with iOS and the same goes for Windows and Mac. The Chromecast stick acts as a transmitter between your TV and the streaming video provider. So it is similar to an antenna. So for example Youtube will broadcast content to your Chromecast, which then will be displayed on your TV. Chromecast is useful for those of you who prefer to watch videos on a larger screen as opposed to the screens of your tablet, phone or PC.</p>
                      
                      <h3>Google Cardboard</h3>
                      <p>o those who have always dreamt of entering a Virtual Reality world, Google has got you covered. Being the good guys that the people at Google are, they have come up with is a cheap, Virtual Reality device which makes VR available to people who do not have the means to buy devices such as the Oculus Rift. This device goes by the name Google Cardboard and as suggested by its name; it literally is a cardboard box with two 40mm focal distance lenses in it. It also uses a rubber band and velcro to keep everything in place. There is also a magnet in there so that when you are wearing the headset, you are able to use this magnet as a button to control your phone’s screen by using your phone’s magnometer. What you will need to enter this magical VR universe is an Android (link to our Android page) smartphone and the Cardboard glasses. Your phone will act as your screen and the two lenses will give you that ‘VR feel’. Like other VR glasses, you can move your head around in real life and you’ll see the effects take place in your virtual world. This is done by simply keeping the camera of your phone uncovered, so that the device can track your movement. Of course, Cardboard only works when compatible apps are running. It also comes with an NFC chip so that when you put your phone into the cardboard, the Cardboard app starts running rightaway.</p>

                   		<p id="buttonclickProducts">Google Cardboard was actually created in the "20 percent project" which allowed Google employees to work on side projects when they were not busy working on their regular tasks.</p>
