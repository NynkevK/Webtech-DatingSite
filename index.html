    				<p>Google: a name that rings a bell for most people nowadays. Most of us use it on a regular basis and the others are either too young or too old to understand, need or care for it. It hasn’t always been this way, though. As any company, this now billion dollar company started out small. It was founded by two PhD candidates named Larry Page and Sergey Brin in 1996.</p>
					<h3 class="heading">Googol</h3>
                    <p>On 14 September 1997 Page and Brin had Google.com registered officially. As you may know, the name Google came from the term ‘googol’ which refers to the number 1 followed by 100 zeros (<i>eventhough we mostly don’t go past page 3 unless in times of true desperation</i>).</p>

                <div class="col-4 heading">
                	<h3 class="heading">Products</h3>
					<p>Google has now brought out several products, however PageRank must have been the most important one. This is the system that, as its name suggests, ranks webpages. It does so based on authority of the given website. This means that the higher is appears in your search, the better the contents. PageRank is a very important part of the core algorithm upon which the search engine operates.</p>
                    <h3 class="heading">What we will cover</h3>
                    <p>On this website of ours, you will find out more about products brought to you by Google, as well as technologies, API’s etc. that have been introduced or improved by Google. You will also learn more about Google’s dominant position in the business and how they got to where they are now.</p>
